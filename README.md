# Material design icons

This package contains a React component for each Material Design Icon svg. So you can just import the Icons you need and get a small bundle instead of loading a big icon font of things you don't even need.

Material design icons is the official [icon set](https://www.google.com/design/spec/style/icons.html#icons-system-icons) from Google.  The icons are designed under the [material design guidelines](https://material.io/guidelines/).

Import an Icon this way-

```js
import from 'material-svg-react-icons/device/react/IcBatter20';
```
